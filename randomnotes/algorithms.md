## using a binary search algorithm
[3, 4, 5, 16, 26,28,52,55]
 0, 1,  2,  3,  4,   5,  6,   7

1. Find the midpoint (we'll round it down if we have even). 
2. Compare the target against the midpoint. If the target is 4 we eliminate everything over 16 and 16.
3. If the target matches the midpoint element, then we've found what we're looking for.
4. Otherwise, determine which direction the bst should proceed.

- Why sort?
sorting makes searching more efficient

### selection sort 
smallest element move it to the front and move boundary

### bubble sort

comparing elements with eachother and swapping them if need be, progressing through the array
